                <p>
                As you may have figured out, I'm Sophie. I'm currently a second-year student at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>, studying <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-honours-computer-science-and-biology">Computer Science and Biology</a>. I know you're probably somewhat busy... so here's 3 quick facts about me:
                <ol>
                <li><b>I recently made a switch from the health field to the tech world, and I'm loving it!</b><br>
                Until a few months ago, I was never much interested in computer science, or anything tech-related for that matter. Actually, the majority of my extra-curricular activities and internships were related to public health and medicine. It was only during my internship in the cardiology department at the <a href="https://www.chumontreal.qc.ca/en/crchum">CRCHUM</a> that I stumbled upon the use of technology in health sciences; more precisely, the use of artifical intelligence for the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. I then began reading on machine learning and over the summer, I decided to take an introductory class to computer science. I ended up really liking it, and so here I am now!</li>
                <li><b>I'm a big mental health advocate.</b><br>
                During my years in <a href="http://www.marianopolis.edu/">CEGEP</a>, I was involved my college's <a href="https://jack.org/Home">Jack.org</a> chapter. Throughout the semesters, we organized activities promoting youth mental health, such as a cultural mental health panel, informative self-care booths and summits. I was also a member of the collegeâ€™s internal Mental Health Taskforce where I led a focus
                groups alongside Student Services staff to survey student needs. </li>
                <li><b>I speak 4 languages.</b><br>
                Growing up in Montreal, I'm fluent in both French and English. I know enough Spanish and Vietnamese. Bonus points! I dabble in ASL, and I took 4 years of Latin in high school. 
                </li>
                </ol>

                            Global Brigades is an international non-profit working towards "resolving health and economic disparities." Unlike some organizations promoting voluntourism, GB has implemented a hollistic model that works towards building community ownership and sustainability. When I was involved with my chapter, we raised more than $50,000 for the cause and collected large amount of health supplies, such as toothbrushes and soap. We volunteered in rural communities in Honduras alongside local leaders on community development projects.
